			Hello network, I wanted to share this project that I am quite proud of. 
			I have been working on it for the past 3 weeks, to challenge myself and improve my 
			skills in DataScience, specifically improving my data Scientist skills. To do that 
			I chose a dataset on Kaggle that includes data about significant earthquakes that 
			have happened since 1st Jan 1965 and up to 31st Dec 2016. Here is the link to get 
			the dataset : <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database">https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			It contains 23K rows which isn’t all that much considering the timespan, but it is what I worked on, 
			as the result isn’t as important to me as the challenge. With this dataframe I was going to create a 
			visualization of earthquakes.
			<br>
			23K rows spread over 21 columns, including the magnitude, latitude, longitude, depth, and the type 
			of earthquake (including nuclear explosions which are considered a type of earthquake).
			<br>
			<br>
			You can see here a gif representing all earthquakes that happened every month in each frame.
			The circles get bigger and whiter with the magnitude. The more a circle is transparent, the deeper 
			it is (under the surface of the sea).

			Then I wanted to see if I could predict the magnitude of an earthquake based on the location, 
			depth, and the type of earthquake. I used sklearn to train a model of Linear Regression,
			I used the data before 2016 to train the model, and the data from 2016 to test the model.
			Using the model I was able to create a dataset of predicted longitude, latitude, depth,
			and magnitude. I then used this dataset to create a visualization of the predicted earthquakes.
